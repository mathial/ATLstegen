  <h1>NEW - The Division LEAGUE !</h3>

  <p><b>Scores should be reported on two places</b>, first in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/193o7RsolU8e86oEfyByBpFHkiM3Tb4ttLdaS_vpBpyk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the dedicated GDrive spreadsheet</a>, where you can check the standings as well.<br>
  Then the score has to be added as weel in the database here. If you have an account, please do it yourself. If not, please send a message to Mathieu ;-)</p>.
  <p><i>The 1st round started the 4th of October</i></p>

  <ul>

    <li>Single tennis matches.</li>
    <li>Divisions of 6 players with similar levels. </li>
    <li>Every player meets the other 5 of his/her division. </li>
    <li>You have 6 weeks to play your 5 matches. </li>
    <li>You plan them the way you want, by contacting your opponents. </li>
    <li>No registration fee, but you pay your booking courts and balls as usual when you book a spot in ATL.</li>
    <li>A match is a one-hour match (details will come soon).</li>
    <li>At the end of the 6 weeks, top 2 players of each div go to upper division. Bottom 2 go down.</li>
    <li>Even if you're away one or 2 weeks, it's fine, as long as you make sure to play your 5 matches within the 6 weeks ;-)</li>
    <li>Open to everyone, juniors and seniors, beginners and rising stars !</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>The first round starts week 40, and ends week 46. </b></p>

  <h3 id="formatmatch">About the format of the matches</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>it must be played during a one hour spot (ATL or elsewhere). The lower ranked player (in stegen) has the priority to choose the surface and place, in case you disagree ;-)</li>
   <li>you don't have to buy a new can of balls. But if possible don't use the one your dog loves. Again, the lower ranked player has the priority to decide in case you disagree ;-)</li>
   <li>you play until the end of the booked spot, and <b>you have to finish the game you started</b>. The big question is how to end a time-limited match ? The best way to do it is to start the final game approximately when 5 minutes remain on the clock. <b>Make sure that you and your opponent agree that you're about to play the final game !</b></li>
   <li>we play NO-AD to make sure that there won't be never-ending deuces</li>
   <li>if it's a tie, then it's a tie :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep in mind that you can use the <a href="{{ path('tennis_calendar_events') }}">sunday evening Stegen spot</a> to organize your matches. You register on mycourt and you notify in the sunday whatsapp group that you will play a 1 hour league match.</p>

  <h3>The division system</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>I did not create (yet?) a page on ligaspel.se or any other website of that kind. Not sure I will. First we'll use a dedicated shared spreadsheet. Link will come soon.</li>
   <li>please report your score once the match played. <b>The exact score is important</b>, since it can be used in case of a tie within the division.</li>
   <li>the scale used is : 3 points for a win. 2 points for a tie. 1 point for a loss. 0 for a withdrawal.</li>
   <li>at the end of the round, the 2 best players move up, the last 2 move down.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>The 1st round stops at the end of week 46, the 21st of November</b>. Of course the matches that were not organized will get both of you 0 point :) Of course if one player is injured and canâ€™t play, then the other one will get the win reward (3points)</p>

  <h3 id="newround">New Round</h3>

  <p><b>New players can join the 2nd round, that will start week 47</b>, and some will maybe stop. I'll make sure to guarantee some justice regarding the up/down moves, and regarding the spots obtained by the newcomers. Priority will be given to players who played the first round. Newcomers will fill in the blanks. And of course we can create more divisions if needed!</p>
