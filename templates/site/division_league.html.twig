  Then the score has to be added as weel in the database here. If you have an account, please do it yourself. If not, please send a message to Mathieu ;-)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Single tennis matches.</li>
    <li>Divisions of 6 players with similar levels. </li>
    <li>Every player meets the other 5 of his/her division. </li>
    <li>You have 8 to 10 weeks to play your 5 matches. </li>
    <li>You plan them the way you want, by contacting your opponents. </li>
    <li>No registration fee, but you pay your booking courts and balls as usual when you book a spot in ATL.</li>
    <li>A match is a one-hour match (details will come soon).</li>
    <li>At the end of the 8-10 weeks, top 2 players of each div go to upper division. Bottom 2 go down.</li>
    <li>Even if you're away one or 2 weeks, it's fine, as long as you make sure to play your 5 matches within the 8-10 weeks ;-)</li>
    <li>Open to everyone, juniors and seniors, beginners and rising stars !</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="formatmatch">About the format of the matches</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>it must be played during a one hour spot (ATL or elsewhere). The lower ranked player (use the column rating-index value!) has the priority to choose the surface and place, in case you disagree ;-)</li>
   <li>you don't have to buy a new can of balls. But if possible don't use the one your dog loves. Again, the lower ranked player has the priority to decide in case you disagree ;-)</li>
   <li>you play until the end of the booked spot, and <b>you have to finish the game you started</b>. The big question is how to end a time-limited match ? The best way to do it is to start the final game approximately when 5 minutes remain on the clock. <b>Make sure that you and your opponent agree that you're about to play the final game !</b></li>
   <li>we play NO-AD to make sure that there won't be never-ending deuces in the final game</li>
   <li>if it's a tie, then it's a tie :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep in mind that you can use the <a href="{{ path('tennis_calendar_events') }}">sunday evening Stegen spot</a> to organize your matches. You register on mycourt and you notify in the sunday whatsapp group that you will play a 1 hour league match.</p>

  <h3>The division system</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>check <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/193o7RsolU8e86oEfyByBpFHkiM3Tb4ttLdaS_vpBpyk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the dedicated GDrive spreadsheet</a></li>
   <li>please report your score once the match is played. Both in the spreadsheet and here if possible.</li>
   <li>the scale used is : 3 points for a win. 2 points for a tie. 1 point for a loss. 0 for a withdrawal.</li>
   <li>at the end of the round, the best 2 players move up, the last 2 move down.</li>
   <li>if 2 or more players end with the same amount of points, we decide between them by using : 1- their head-to-head result during this round. 2- the number of matches played without W/O. 3- the game difference. 4- the number of games scored.</li>
   <li>if some matches are not played at the end of the round, because one player was injured or away for a long time : this player will get a W/O (0pt), the other one will get a win with a 2-0 score.</li>
   <li>if a match is planned and then cancelled the very final week-end of the round, without any other alternative to get this match played, the W/O will be only for the player "guilty" of the cancellation. The other one will get a win.</li>
   <li>if some matches are not played at the end of the round, because the two players did not find a way to arrange it : both of them will get a W/O (0pt)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>The matches that were not organized before the final day of the round will get both of you 0 point !</b> If one player is injured and canâ€™t play, then the other one will get the win reward (3points) with the score of 2-0.</p>

  <h3 id="newround">New Round</h3>

  <p><b>New players can join the 5th round, that will start week 33</b>, and some will maybe stop. I'll make sure to guarantee some justice regarding the up/down moves, and regarding the spots obtained by the newcomers. Priority will be given to players who played the first round. Newcomers will fill in the blanks. And of course we can create more divisions if needed!</p>

  <h3 id="detailsRatingsAvg">Details for the averange ratings used to create the divs, or add new players</h3>

  <p>Please find below the list of players used for the 1st round. The average rankings is the Stegen rankings from 2021 (average of all the unique ratings for each players). Newcomers get an estimation.</p>
  <p>With the round 2 we started to use this method : <b>average of the <u>unique</u> ratings for each players during the last 6months.</b></p>
