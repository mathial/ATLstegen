  <h3>The LEAGUE !</h3>

  <p>A new format that started in September 2021. Players are distributed in divisions of 6 players, according to their levels. During one round, each player is supposed to meet all the other players of his division. A round can last approximately 6 to 8 weeks. Players self-organize their matches, by booking 1-hour spots. At the end of the round, the top2 players of each division move up, the bottom 2 go down.<br>
  New players can enter/quit the League when a new round starts.<br>
